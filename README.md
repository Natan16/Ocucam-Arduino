Ocucam-Arduino
==============

Ocucam with Rift support and Arduino interfacing

==============

This is an adaptation of Scott Cuttler's Ocucam software. The software now reads orientation data
from a Rift headset and sends that data over Serial to an Arduino-compatible board, where it is
then transformed into servo movements.

Arduino code will be available on the repo as well.
